## Examining the Role of Mathematical Language in Preschoolers’ Social and Behavioral Outcomes: A Hierarchical Linear Modeling Approach

The present study used a sample of 558 preschool children (Mage = 57.75 months, SD = 3.71). Monthly family income ranged from \$0 to \$5539 (M = \$1508.18, SD = \$892.92). Among the sample, 44% of the children were African American, 32% were Caucasian, 12% were Hispanic, 11% were multiracial, and 1% were Asian.

-   RQ1: Does vocabulary and mathematical language predict social skills in preschoolers?

Hypothesis 1: Higher vocabulary and math language will be associated with better social skills.

-   RQ2: Does vocabulary and mathematical language predict problem behavior in preschoolers?

Hypothesis 2: Lower vocabulary and math language will be associated with higher problem behavior.
