Each student in this data has a score for accuracy and fluency of math pinpoints at intake and then their score for those skills on a CBM after 40 hours of instruction.\n\nThis report includes: **Sample visualizations** to understand the sample of participants. **Data reshaping** to convert the dataset into a tidy format. **Analysis for three research questions** using clustering, regression, and ANCOVA.\n\n**###Research Questions and Methods:###**\n\n1.  **What math skills, when grouped, predict other skills?**\n\n    -   First **Hierarchical clustering** is used to identify skill groupings based on similar learning patterns.\n\n2.  **What math skills predict outcomes on the CBM after 40 hours of instruction?**\n\n    -   Next **multiple regression modeling** is applied to determine predictive relationships.\n\n3.  **How do targeted versus untargeted math skills relate to CBM outcomes?**\n\n    -   **ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance)** is used to examine differences between these skill types.\n\nBefore loading the dataset, I cleaned it in a separate script to remove names and replace them with unique ID numbers for student privacy.\n\nIn this project, the first step I took was to load all required R packages. For data manipulation (`tidyverse`), visualizations (`ggplot2`), clustering analysis (`cluster`), tidying model outputs (`broom`), and running regression models (`lme4`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the visualizations of the sample participants. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Reshape Data to Tidy Format\n\n[edit this now that changes were made\\]I reshaped the dataset to a \"tidy\" format, where each row represents: Participant_ID, Grade Level, Diagnosis, Skill, Measure\\` (Intake Accuracy, Post Fluency, etc.), Score. I converted categorical variables to factors to avoid regression errors. And I removed levels with only one category to prevent contrast errors in regression.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nTotal rows: 124200 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nNA values in Score: 47403 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nPercentage NA: 38.16667 %\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  Column_1 Column_2 Column_3  Skill                                Measure Score\n     <dbl> <chr>    <chr>     <chr>                                <chr>   <dbl>\n1        3 None     2nd Grade Skip Count by 10 Forwards to 1,000 … <NA>       84\n2        3 None     2nd Grade Skip Count by 10 Forwards to 1,000 … <NA>      100\n3        3 None     2nd Grade Skip Count by 10 Forwards to 1,000 … <NA>       92\n4        3 None     2nd Grade Skip Count by 10 Forwards to 1,000 … <NA>      100\n5        3 None     2nd Grade Skip Count by 10 Forwards to 1,000 … <NA>        0\n6        3 None     2nd Grade Skip Count by 10 Backwards From 1,0… <NA>       NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n////// \\## Answer Research Questions\n\n### **Q1: What math skills, when grouped, predict other skills?**\n\nto address this I used a **Correlation analysis** to identify skills that **improve together**. Then I did **Association rule mining** to find patterns where mastering one skill predicts mastery of another. I then created the following visualizations: a **correlation heatmap** and **association rule graph**.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
