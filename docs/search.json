    "text": "I am a PhD student in Special Education and Clinical Science at the University of Oregon, specializing in Educational Data Science. My research focuses on improving outcomes for students with disabilities, particularly through early intervention and autism research. I study how evidence-based interventions can support the development of learning-related social skills in young children, ensuring they have a strong foundation for future success.\nMy work as a Precision Teacher and Behavior Analyst informs my research in the use of precise behavioral measurement and educational data science to refine interventions and assess their broader impact.\nOne of my primary research methodologies is evidence synthesis through systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses, I evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and translate findings into meaningful practice and policy recommendations. My work is grounded in the belief that data-driven decision-making can enhance teaching practices and lead to meaningful improvements in student outcomes.\nBefore pursuing my PhD, I worked as a special education teacher, where I gained firsthand experience in developing individualized instruction for students with diverse learning needs. That experience continues to shape my research and reinforces my dedication to bridging the gap between research and practice. Through my work, I aim to contribute to a more equitable education system where all students receive the support they need to thrive.\nThis blog highlights my research in special education, early intervention, autism, and educational data science. My goal is to share insights that bridge the gap between research and practice, informing educators, practitioners, and policymakers.\n\nContact\nFeel free to contact me via email at smeans@uoregon.edu"

    "text": "This following post utilized data from a private precision teaching clinic in the United States. Each student in this data has a score for accuracy and fluency of math pinpoints at intake and then their score for those skills on a CBM after 40 hours of instruction.\nThis report includes: Sample visualizations to understand the sample of participants. Data reshaping to convert the dataset into a tidy format. Analysis for three research questions using clustering, regression, and ANCOVA.\n###Research Questions and Methods:###\nBefore loading the dataset, I cleaned it in a separate script to remove names and replace them with unique ID numbers for student privacy.\nIn this project, the first step I took was to load all required R packages. For data manipulation (tidyverse), visualizations (ggplot2), clustering analysis (cluster), tidying model outputs (broom), and running regression models (lme4).\nHere are the visualizations of the sample participants."

The ICC values suggest that school-level factors account for 21% of variance in social skills and 28% in problem behavior, emphasizing the importance of school environments in shaping social outcomes. Effect size measures confirm that these models explain a significant proportion of variance in preschoolers’ social and behavioral outcomes."

    "text": "hlsn/lkcdnc Homogeneous Achievement Grouping (HAG) provides a structured and research-backed method for maximizing student achievement by organizing instruction based on skill level while maintaining flexibility for student progression. Unlike rigid tracking systems, which have been criticized for limiting student mobility, HAG emphasizes frequent reassessment, ensuring that students can move between groups based on demonstrated progress (Tieso, 2003).\nExtensive research confirms the effectiveness of HAG in promoting academic success. Slavin (1987) found that within-class ability grouping for mathematics (median effect size = +.34) and cross-grade ability grouping for reading using the Joplin Plan (median effect size = +.45) both produced substantial positive impacts on student achievement. These findings highlight that reducing student heterogeneity in specific skill areas while adjusting instruction to students’ needs leads to meaningful academic gains.\nFurther supporting this approach, Gentry (1999) demonstrated that cluster grouping, a model in which high-achieving students are placed together in a classroom while distributing other achievement levels strategically, led to higher identification rates of advanced learners and fewer students labeled as low-achieving. Over time, students in this model surpassed their peers in traditionally structured classrooms, even when they initially started with lower achievement scores.\nAdditionally, research indicates that small, flexible group sizes enhance learning outcomes. Adelson and Carpenter (2011) found that achievement grouping led to greater reading growth for all kindergarteners, with even stronger effects in smaller groups. This supports the notion that precision grouping fosters optimal learning environments, allowing teachers to tailor instruction to student ability levels effectively.\nWhen implemented thoughtfully, HAG mitigates achievement disparities while ensuring instructional effectiveness. By structuring learning environments to match student skill levels and allowing movement between groups based on progress, HAG represents a proven, evidence-based strategy for maximizing student achievement across all levels."

An integrative review is a structured approach that synthesizes both empirical and conceptual literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of a phenomenon (Whittemore & Knafl, 2005). This method is particularly valuable for defining complex educational concepts, reviewing theories and evidence, and analyzing methodological issues related to inclusion and ability grouping. While integrative reviews can present challenges related to synthesizing multiple study designs, they allow for a broader examination of theoretical and empirical perspectives (Grant & Booth, 2009). Despite these challenges, this approach provides a robust framework for evaluating existing research while contextualizing findings by integrating several forms of peer reviewed studies. \nTo ensure methodological rigor, elements of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework were adapted for this review. The literature search was conducted through academic databases, including PsycINFO, ERIC, Medline, and PubMed. The search strategy incorporated key terms related to HAG, inclusive education, student achievement, and public education policies. Studies were selected based on their relevance to inclusive education and ability grouping, empirical rigor, and applicability to policy and instructional practice. The review includes meta-analyses, qualitative studies, quantitative analyses, and conceptual papers that explore the implications of HAG in inclusive settings (Slavin, 1987; Lou et al., 1996; Cosier, Causton-Theoharis, & Theoharis, 2013). Studies that focused exclusively on postsecondary education or examined grouping based on non-academic factors were excluded. This approach ensures a comprehensive synthesis of research on how HAG can support inclusive education.\nThe data collection process adhered to structured procedures, ensuring all included studies were critically evaluated for their contributions to understanding HAG as an instructional tool. While a PRISMA flow diagram was not used due to the narrative nature of an integrative review, elements of the PRISMA checklist were applied, including clear documentation of sources, eligibility criteria, and synthesis methods (Page et al., 2021). \nIn addition to the literature review, a systematic document review of publicly available education data from Washington and Oregon was conducted. Reports from the Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (2024), Oregon’s state funding report (Khurana, 2025), and the U.S. Department of Education EDFacts Data Warehouse (2023) were analyzed to identify trends in student enrollment, special education placement, teacher qualifications, and funding allocations. These sources provide insights into the current state of inclusive education in the PNW and help contextualize findings from the literature review. As PRISMA-S emphasizes structured reporting of search strategies, this review explicitly documents state-level datasets and policy reports. \nThe PNW was selected as the focus of this review due to its high proportion of master’s-level educated teachers, uniquely positioning the region to implement evidence-based instructional strategies. The presence of a highly qualified teaching workforce may present an advantage in adopting research-backed approaches like HAG, making the region an ideal case study for hypothesizing potential improvements in inclusive education practices. By synthesizing empirical literature with regional education data, this review generates insights into how HAG could address inclusion gaps and inform policy adaptations. The methodological approach ensures transparency and replicability by aligning with established guidelines for integrative reviews. This study does not involve primary data collection but relies entirely on previously published research and publicly available education reports."

    "section": "Key Findings",
    "text": "Key Findings\nInclusion Improves Outcomes but Faces Barriers\nResearch consistently demonstrates that inclusive education improves both academic and social outcomes for students with disabilities. Meta-analyses confirm that students in inclusive settings achieve higher academically and experience better social integration than those in segregated special education classrooms (Baker, Wang, & Walberg, 1994; Cosier et al., 2013). However, significant barriers persist in implementing inclusion effectively. Teacher preparedness, curriculum adaptation, and structural constraints continue to limit the success of inclusive education (Ballard & Dymond, 2017). Research highlights that while inclusion is widely accepted in principle, practical implementation remains inconsistent due to inadequate resources, lack of professional development, and varying teacher attitudes (Carter & Hughes, 2006).\nHAG can Enhance Inclusion If Applied Strategically\nHAG has the potential to support inclusive education when implemented with flexibility and frequent reassessment. Within-class ability grouping has been found to enhance student outcomes in math and reading, particularly when instruction is tailored to student needs (Slavin, 1987; Lou et al., 1996). However, concerns about rigid tracking persist, as it has been shown to exacerbate educational inequities by limiting opportunities for lower-achieving students (Oakes, 1992, 2008). To mitigate these risks, research supports the implementation of skill-based grouping models with regular reassessment to ensure mobility between groups and prevent long-term stratification (Adelson & Carpenter, 2011).\nGeographic and Structural Disparities in Inclusion\nGeographic location significantly influences inclusive education practices. Students in urban districts are more likely to experience segregated placements compared to their rural counterparts, with large urban districts showing the lowest rates of inclusion (Brock & Schaefer, 2015). The application of HAG could serve as an intervention strategy to address disparities in student achievement by providing differentiated instruction within inclusive classrooms, rather than separating students based on perceived ability.\nFindings from Pacific Northwest Data\nAnalysis of publicly available education data from Oregon and Washington highlights several structural challenges in achieving inclusive education. Washington reports a per-pupil expenditure of $18,649, with 50.3% of students demonstrating grade-level proficiency in ELA and 39.7% in math (Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, 2024). In Oregon, students with disabilities account for 15% of total enrollment, a group that receives additional funding weights in the state funding formula (Khurana, 2025). However, disparities persist, particularly in urban districts where students with disabilities are placed in more restrictive settings at higher rates. The number of students eligible for the High-Cost Disability Fund has doubled since 2003, indicating rising special education expenditures that outpace state reimbursement (Khurana, 2025). The availability of fully certified special education teachers also varies, with Oregon employing 3,492.84 special educators, 499.30 of whom are not fully certified, while Washington employs 6,943.84 special educators, with 205.75 not fully certified (U.S. Department of Education, 2023). These discrepancies suggest that teacher shortages and funding limitations may contribute to the uneven implementation of inclusion policies.\nResearch findings\n\nHow can HAG serve as a driver for effective inclusive education that maximizes both academic and social outcomes? Research indicates that HAG, when applied with flexibility and frequent reassessment, can enhance differentiated instruction without reinforcing segregation. Strategic implementation allows educators to meet diverse learning needs within inclusive classrooms, supporting both academic growth and social integration (Slavin, 1987; Gentry, 1999).\nWhat do state-level data from Oregon and Washington reveal about current challenges and practices? The data suggest that funding structures and teacher shortages present significant barriers to inclusive education in the Pacific Northwest. Urban districts exhibit lower inclusion rates, and the demand for special education services has increased, outpacing available resources (Khurana, 2025; U.S. Department of Education, 2023).\nWhat policy shifts are needed to ensure equitable, effective implementation of HAG within inclusive settings? Policies should focus on increasing funding allocations for inclusive education, addressing teacher shortages through targeted recruitment and professional development, and ensuring HAG practices are designed to be flexible and responsive to student progress. Implementing HAG with regular reassessment and professional training for educators can optimize its benefits for inclusion while avoiding the pitfalls of rigid tracking (Adelson & Carpenter, 2011; Oakes, 1992).\n\nHAG presents a promising strategy for enhancing inclusive education when implemented thoughtfully. However, achieving meaningful inclusion requires addressing systemic barriers related to funding, teacher preparation, and structural disparities in educational placement. The findings underscore the need for evidence-based policy adaptations to ensure that all students, regardless of ability level, receive equitable opportunities for academic and social success.\nImplications and Policy Recommendations\nReframing HAG as a Tool for Inclusive Education\nTo fully realize the benefits of homogeneous achievement grouping (HAG) in inclusive education, it is essential to reject rigid tracking models in favor of adaptive, flexible grouping structures. Research consistently highlights that rigid tracking exacerbates educational inequities by limiting mobility and reinforcing disparities in student achievement (Oakes, 1992, 2008). Instead, HAG should be embedded within existing inclusion frameworks, ensuring that student placement remains dynamic and responsive to individual progress. Studies indicate that when grouping structures allow for frequent reassessment and movement based on skill development, students across all ability levels benefit academically and socially (Slavin, 1987). Implementing HAG in a way that enhances, rather than restricts, student access to general education settings will maximize its effectiveness as an inclusion-supporting strategy.\nInvesting in Teacher Training and Support\nA critical factor in the successful implementation of HAG within inclusive classrooms is teacher training and professional development. Educators need structured guidance on differentiated instruction, flexible grouping, and adaptive teaching strategies to ensure HAG benefits all students. Research underscores the importance of professional development in equipping teachers with the skills necessary to implement evidence-based grouping practices effectively (Hall, 2002). Additionally, fostering teacher collaboration models can enhance instructional quality and increase teacher confidence in using HAG strategies to support diverse learners (Hunt et al., 2003; Bouillet, 2013). Professional learning communities and co-teaching frameworks can provide ongoing peer support, ensuring that teachers have the resources to apply HAG effectively within inclusive settings.\nEnhancing Data Transparency and Accountability\nTo ensure that HAG is applied equitably and effectively, school districts must adopt data transparency and accountability measures. Districts should be required to track and report HAG implementation practices, student mobility between groups, and performance outcomes. Regular reporting will allow policymakers and educators to monitor whether HAG supports student growth without reinforcing tracking-based segregation. Additionally, performance-based movement between groups should be prioritized, allowing students to transition fluidly based on progress rather than static labels (Adelson & Carpenter, 2011). Ensuring that grouping practices are data-driven and student-centered will help maintain the integrity of HAG as a tool for inclusion rather than a mechanism for stratification.\nPolicy Action Steps for Oregon and Washington\nTo effectively integrate HAG into inclusive education programs, state-level policy initiatives are necessary. First, Oregon and Washington should mandate the adoption of flexible, research-based HAG models within inclusion programs to ensure that grouping practices remain adaptive and do not reinforce existing achievement gaps. Second, targeted funding should be allocated for teacher training on HAG and differentiated instruction to equip educators with the necessary skills to implement these models effectively. Finally, states should incentive pilot programs that integrate HAG within inclusive classrooms, allowing districts to test and refine best practices before scaling implementation statewide. Investing in these initiatives will help ensure that HAG is used strategically to enhance, rather than hinder, inclusive education, ultimately promoting equitable access to quality learning experiences for all students."
