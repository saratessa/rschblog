    "text": "I am a PhD student in Special Education and Clinical Science at the University of Oregon, specializing in Educational Data Science. My research focuses on improving outcomes for students with disabilities, particularly through early intervention and autism research. I study how evidence-based interventions can support the development of learning-related social skills in young children, ensuring they have a strong foundation for future success.\nMy work as a Precision Teacher and Behavior Analyst informs my research in the use of precise behavioral measurement and educational data science to refine interventions and assess their broader impact.\nOne of my primary research methodologies is evidence synthesis through systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses, I evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and translate findings into meaningful practice and policy recommendations. My work is grounded in the belief that data-driven decision-making can enhance teaching practices and lead to meaningful improvements in student outcomes.\nBefore pursuing my PhD, I worked as a special education teacher, where I gained firsthand experience in developing individualized instruction for students with diverse learning needs. That experience continues to shape my research and reinforces my dedication to bridging the gap between research and practice. Through my work, I aim to contribute to a more equitable education system where all students receive the support they need to thrive.\nThis blog highlights my research in special education, early intervention, autism, and educational data science. My goal is to share insights that bridge the gap between research and practice, informing educators, practitioners, and policymakers.\n\nContact\nFeel free to contact me via email at smeans@uoregon.edu"

    "text": "This following post utilized data from a private precision teaching clinic in the United States.

Then I did Association rule mining to find patterns where mastering one skill predicts mastery of another. I then created the following visualizations: a correlation heatmap and association rule graph.\n\n# Create a correlation matrix for skill scores\n\n\n# Visualize correlation matrix"
